		<h1>Common Exercises</h1>
		<p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
		<dl>
		<dt>Burpee</dt>
		<dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strengt and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.</dd>
		
		<dt>Plank</dt>
