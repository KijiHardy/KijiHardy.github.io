	<p>Based in Ohio, I've been in love with computers my entire life. I can't recall a time in my life where a form of computer didn't contribute something significant to my life. I'm an aspiring programmer attending CVCC for programming and software development. In the near future I would like to find work as a programmer, building things for the internet that brought me up. In the future, I'd like to attend a 4-year college for a degree in biotechnology, using my dedication to technology and to people to fuel my career.</p>
